        <p>
            You don’t have to be a restaurant chef to know how to cook steak perfectly. Steak is a fast-cooking meat that you can prepare in minutes over the stove or in the oven. How you cook your steak and for how long, however, depend on the cut, grade and thickness of your meat. Take time to learn a little bit about the steak you’re cooking to ensure great results.
