        <h3><em>Pinoy Steak</em></h3>
        <p>
            You don’t have to be a restaurant chef to know how to cook steak perfectly. Steak is a fast-cooking meat that you can prepare in minutes over the stove or in the oven. How you cook your steak and for how long, however, depend on the cut, grade and thickness of your meat. Take time to learn a little bit about the steak you’re cooking to ensure great results.

         <h2>Ingredients</h2>
         <ul>
            <li>2 8 ounces New York strip steak,or any steak cut that you prefer.</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper for rubbing</li>
            <li>1 to 2 tablespoons cooking oil</li>
         </ul>
         <h2>Steps</h2>
         <ol>
            <li>Rub salt and pepper allover the steak.You can also use your favorite steak rub.</li>
            <li>Before pan-frying steak, it is a good idea to rub it in a bit of oil first.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet, heat a tablespoon or two of cooking oil. If you like your steak rare set the heat to high. If you prefer yours medium, adjust to medium heat.</li>
            <li>Wait until the oil is sizzling hot and add the steak. Cook meat until it forms a brown crust, turn it over and cook on the other side. Avoid moving steak while it is cooking.</li>
            <li>Watch the juices. If there are juices on top of the steak after cooking both sides, it is still rare. The best way to continue cooking it is either transferring it to the oven, or wrapping it in foil to cook until medium rare.</li>
            <li>Serve.
         </ol>
