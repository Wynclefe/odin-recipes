        <h3><em>Chicken Parmesan</em></h3>
        <p>
            Chicken Parmesan (also called Chicken Parmigiana) is one of the most loved, most popular AND most ordered chicken recipes in the world. BUT often times, chicken comes out too dry, or doesn’t have enough flavour or seasoning. The sauce is bland, or cheddar cheese is used instead of mozzarella, etc.

            <li>1/2 cup olive oil for frying</li>
         </ul>
         <h3> For the Sauce:</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 large onion chopped</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
            <li>14 ounces (400 g) tomato puree (Passata)</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried Italian herbs</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sugar (optional)</li>
         </ul>
         <h3> For the Topping:</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>8 ounces (250 g) mozzarella cheese sliced or shredded</li>
            <li>1/3 cup fresh shredded parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons fresh chopped basil or parsley</li>
         </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven 430°F | 220°C. Lightly grease an oven tray (or baking dish) with non stick cooking oil spray; set aside.</li>
            <li>Whisk together eggs, garlic, parsley, salt and pepper in a shallow dish. Add chicken into the egg, rotating to evenly coat each fillet in the mixture. Cover with plastic wrap and allow to marinate for at least 15 minutes (or overnight night if time allows for a deeper flavour).</li>
            <li>When chicken is ready for cooking, mix bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese and garlic powder together in a separate shallow bowl. Dip chicken into the breadcrumb mixture to evenly coat.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until hot and shimmering. Fry chicken until golden and crispy, (about 4-5 minutes each side).</li>
        </ol>
